# Flappybird
Requirements
Knowledge
We know our way around Unity and heard about GameObjects and Transforms before, then you are ready to go. And if you didn't, don't worry about it too much.


Unity Version
Our Flappy Bird will use Unity 2020.1.1 LTS installed through the Unity Hub. Please adapt this guide to your version of Unity, however to keep things simple, we recommend using the same version as the guide. That doesn't mean you can't use a newer Unity version as they should work fine as well, but keep in mind that older versions may or may not work.
